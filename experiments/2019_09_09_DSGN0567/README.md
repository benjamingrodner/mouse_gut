# README for 2019_09_09_DSGN0567 in mouse gut

My idea is to use segmentation and identification data from HiPR FISH imaging to create a feature matrix describing the spatial taxonomic structure surrounding each cell.
Then I would be able to cluster all the cells in high dimensional space.
I would expect that cells would smear across high dimensional space as cells close to each other in real space would have only slightly different neigboring structures.
I hope that there are cells that cluster that are not near each other in real space. 
These clusters would define standard structures and we might be able to identify taxa or groups of taxa that are the focal points for these structures.
Hopefully then we could look at changes in spatial structure between treatment and control. 

I've pulled a set of data from Hao's directory:
